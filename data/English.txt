Can you please explain numberwang to me? I've watched all the sketches and i really don't understand
It's pretty simple. You have to remember that they play the Standard International rules because it makes for better syndication, where as you're probably used to the George VI set when you play down the pub.
As long as they're not playing the '12.06 Euston Connection' ruleset it's ok with me.
Why they wanted to unify the scoring system with that of Mornington Crescent is beyond me.
I think, given the two recent spectator fatalities at the National Championships due to overenthusiastic lip puddling it's sensible (at least in competition play where Queen Elizabeth moves are valid) to make this move.
On a sidenote, I tend to find this a little irritating - why on earth does the governing body continue to allow QE moves in competition play? It allows for the utterly imbalanced Tuesday Tube Strike Gambit, which as far as I'm concerned means you may as well hand the trophy to whoever starts third. 12:06 Euston Connection would allow for much more varied play. Heck, you could even have a better game playing the Zones 1-6 Travelcard ruleset (with the caveat of no baggage, of course), and that's outdated as shit.
Granted, the Zones 1-6 Travelcard ruleset is incredibly outdated, but don't forget the blindingly genius employment of those rules in last year's European Championship quarterfinals by Smorg Snegsson, who completely took his opponent by surprise with what was, up til that point, an archaic play. Snegsson of course the favourite to win that championship until he was broken in the final with a Barons Court Shunt in the first minute, taking into account the Honourable Kempby Challenge.
true, true, but the lack of victoria line penalties and the way the king's cross playthroughs take a minimum of 4 moves really harm the metagame and limit the possibility of inverted plays. The committee need to modernise or they'll have to deal with the game being needlessly predictable.
I'm an american... I don't know where I am or how I got here.
I went to Southern France and found the French to be very hospitable. I'm so confused inside.
The new guy just brought in a 'Keep Calm and Play Golf' mug for his coffee. He has no chance of making friends now.
I find the new Tesco adverts disconcertingly sexual.
In ASDA burgers are sold in packs of four, and rolls in packs of six. It's bloody scandalous.
Parcel Farce managed to successfully deliver a package to me. On time. I don't know what to think anymore.
So far today, I have seen seven different versions of the 'keep calm and...' t-shirt.
For the last time.....I am NOT on a Stay-cation. I am just skint and can't afford a holiday.
My sister just called I'm Alan Partridge "terrible", then proceeded to change the channel to watch Geordie Shore.
When my wife invites her friends round I put less milk in the tea so they drink slowly and I can play Xbox for longer. Now they think I make crap brews.
Lunchtime pints: saviour of a Friday?
The Daily Mail just ran a front page headline that's as close as they dare get to slating 'sending money to Bongo-Bongo land'
"From One Second to the Next," the rather unlikely film below, came together when AT&T approached the legendary German filmmaker Werner Herzog and asked if he would direct a series of short films warning people about the dangers of texting while driving.
"What AT&T proposed immediately clicked and connected inside of me," Herzog told the AP. "There's a completely new culture out there. I'm not a participant of texting and driving—or texting at all—but I see there's something going on in civilization which is coming with great vehemence at us."
The result is haunting. It focuses on four accidents, some of them fatal, and Herzog aims his camera squarely at the faces of both victims and perpetrators, asking them to describe in detail what happened and the aftermath. Herzog emphasizes the change in civilization he perceives in part by examining an accident in which an Amish family was killed and another in which a horse-shoer's truck was involved.
It is not easy viewing, but, for the "more than 40,000 high schools" and "hundreds of safety organizations and government agencies" where it will be shown, I suspect it will be effective. As Herzog says, "In one second, entire lives are either wiped out or changed forever."
His family belonged to the Missouri Synod Lutheran Church. When he was in the eighth grade, he discovered Charles Darwin, and was caught reading The Origin of Species in church. Later in life, he rejected religion.[5] Due to lack of money, he almost failed to attend college. His eldest brother interceded, and Hilleman graduated first in his class from Montana State University with family help and scholarships. He won a fellowship to the University of Chicago and received his doctoral degree in microbiology in 1941. His doctoral thesis was on chlamydia, which was then thought to be caused by a virus. Hilleman showed that the disease was in fact caused by an unusual bacterium which grew only inside of cells.
